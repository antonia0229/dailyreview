         <h2 id="Aboutme">About me</h2>
             <p>	I was born on February 29th in the year 2000, and in Clovis California. 
             Some of my hobbies include playing my guitar, hanging out with friends, baking, 
             and Netflix of course. I also like traveling, if I could go anywhere in world I would go to Paris. 
             I have also been to New York and I love it there, I wish I could live there. </p>
             
             <p>	I think family is the most important thing in life. My family is kind of complex.
             My mom, before having me, had my brother with my brothers dad while my dad was having my sister 
             with my sisters mom. Then my parents met, got married and had me. 
             I love both my brother and sister but I would say I am closer with my brother because we are closer in age.
             But at the end of the day I love my family more than anything in the world. </p>
         <h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>
            <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                <p>One long term goal I have is to open a restaurant. Before I do that I want to go to culinary school,
                but I am not sure where. My goal for opening a restaurant is to bring smiles to peoples face through food. 
                I believe food is the easiest way to make someone smile. The culture of food is so diverse I want to explore 
                it as much as I can.</p>
                <p>Another goal I have is get married and have a family, I know I am only fifteen but the thought of 
                having as family makes me feel like I have something to work toward.  Having as family means coming home 
                to people who love you and are always there for you. It also means you have a responsibility, having kids 
                gives you something to take care of and nurture. </p>
            <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                <p>		I want to manage my time better. Managing my time better will allow me to tern thing in on time, 
                show up to school on time, and make priorities. Putting my priorities in order is important because it keeps 
                me organized. Being organized is being professional and managing time better is also being professional. </p>
                <p></p>

            <h3>Educational</h3>
                <p>One thing I hope to accomplish is get a 4.0 GPA. I plan on working extremely hard. I plan on turning 
                everything on in time, going above and beyond what is expected of me. All of my work should reflect the 
                time and effort I put into it. I want to show my teachers and parents what I can do if I put just a little
                more effort into my school work.</p>
            <h3>Personal</h3>
                <p>One thing I want to do in the near future is pass my drivers training test.  After that I want to get 
                my actual drivers license.  I think driving takes a lot of responsibility and I want to show my parts what 
                I can do when I take care of my responsibilities.  I am prepared for the extensive studying it will take to
                pass my drivers test. </p>
